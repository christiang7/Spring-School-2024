Abstract
We present our current best estimate of the plausible observing scenarios for the
Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors over
the next several years, with the intention of providing information to facilitate
planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We estimate the
sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals for the third (O3),
fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including the planned upgrades of the
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We study the capability of the
network to determine the sky location of the source for gravitational-wave signals
from the inspiral of binary systems of compact objects, that is binary neutron star,
neutron star–black hole, and binary black hole systems. The ability to localize the
sources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comoving
volume. The median sky localization area (90% credible region) is expected to be a
few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3 with the
Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization area will
improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced LIGO, Virgo,
and KAGRA (HLVK) network. During O3, the median localization volume (90%
credible region) is expected to be on the order of 105 ; 106 ; 107 Mpc3 for binary
neutron star, neutron star–black hole, and binary black hole systems, respectively.

Change summary Major revision, updated and expanded.
Change details Since publication of the previous version (Abbott et al 2018f), several updates to the
document have been made. The most significant changes are that we now frame our projections in terms
of observing runs, we include final results from O2, and we updated our localization projections to
include KAGRA as a fourth detector. Key differences are outlined in the Appendix.

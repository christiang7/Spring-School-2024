Abstract. The discovery of the accelerating universe in the late 1990s was
a watershed moment in modern cosmology, as it indicated the presence of a
fundamentally new, dominant contribution to the energy budget of the universe.
Evidence for dark energy, the new component that causes the acceleration, has
since become extremely strong, owing to an impressive variety of increasingly
precise measurements of the expansion history and the growth of structure in the
universe. Still, one of the central challenges of modern cosmology is to shed light
on the physical mechanism behind the accelerating universe. In this review, we
briefly summarize the developments that led to the discovery of dark energy. Next,
we discuss the parametric descriptions of dark energy and the cosmological tests
that allow us to better understand its nature. We then review the cosmological
probes of dark energy. For each probe, we briefly discuss the physics behind it
and its prospects for measuring dark energy properties. We end with a summary
of the current status of dark energy research.

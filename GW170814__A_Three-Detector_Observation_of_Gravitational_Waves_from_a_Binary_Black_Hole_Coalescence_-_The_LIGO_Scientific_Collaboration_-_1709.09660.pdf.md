GW170814: A Three-Detector Observation of Gravitational Waves
from a Binary Black Hole Coalescence
B. P. Abbott et al.*
(LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration)
(Received 23 September 2017; published 6 October 2017)
On August 14, 2017 at 10∶30:43 UTC, the Advanced Virgo detector and the two Advanced LIGO
detectors coherently observed a transient gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two
stellar mass black holes, with a false-alarm rate of ≲1 in 27 000 years. The signal was observed with a
three-detector network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 18. The inferred masses of the initial black
þ2.8
holes are 30.5þ5.7
−3.0 M ⊙ and 25:3−4.2 M ⊙ (at the 90% credible level). The luminosity distance of the source is
þ0.03
540þ130
−210 Mpc, corresponding to a redshift of z ¼ 0.11−0.04 . A network of three detectors improves the sky
localization of the source, reducing the area of the 90% credible region from 1160 deg2 using only the two
LIGO detectors to 60 deg2 using all three detectors. For the first time, we can test the nature of
gravitational-wave polarizations from the antenna response of the LIGO-Virgo network, thus enabling a
new class of phenomenological tests of gravity.

I. INTRODUCTION
The era of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy began
with the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, by
the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) detectors [1], during the first of the
Advanced Detector Observation Runs. Three detections,
GW150914 [2], GW151226 [3], and GW170104 [4], and a
lower significance candidate, LVT151012 [5], have been
announced so far. The Advanced Virgo detector [6] joined
the second observation run on August 1, 2017.
On August 14, 2017, GWs from the coalescence of two
black holes at a luminosity distance of 540þ130
−210 Mpc, with
þ5.7
þ2.8
masses of 30.5−3.0 M⊙ and 25.3−4.2 M⊙ , were observed in all
three detectors. The signal was first observed at the LIGO
Livingston detector at 10∶30:43 UTC, and at the LIGO
Hanford and Virgo detectors with a delay of ∼8 ms and
∼14 ms, respectively.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series, the timefrequency representation of the strain data, and the time
series data of the three detectors together with the inferred
GW waveform, are shown in Fig. 1. The different sensitivities and responses of the three detectors result in the GW
producing different values of matched-filter SNR in each
detector.
Three methods were used to assess the impact of the
Virgo instrument on this detection. (a) Using the best fit

waveform obtained from analysis of the LIGO detectors’
data alone, we find that the probability, in 5000 s of data
around the event, of a peak in SNR from Virgo data due to
noise and as large as the one observed, within a time
window determined by the maximum possible time of
flight, is 0.3%. (b) A search for unmodeled GW transients
demonstrates that adding Advanced Virgo improves the
false-alarm rate by an order of magnitude over the
two-detector network. (c) We compare the matched-filter
marginal likelihood for a model with a coherent BBH
signal in all three detectors to that for a model assuming
pure Gaussian noise in Virgo and a BBH signal only in the
LIGO detectors: the three detector BBH signal model is
preferred with a Bayes factor of more than 1600.
Until Advanced Virgo became operational, typical GW
position estimates were highly uncertain compared to the
fields of view of most telescopes. The baseline formed by
the two LIGO detectors allowed us to localize most mergers
to roughly annular regions spanning hundreds to about a
thousand square degrees at the 90% credible level [7–9].
Virgo adds additional independent baselines, which in
cases such as GW170814 can reduce the positional
uncertainty by an order of magnitude or more [8].
Tests of general relativity (GR) in the strong field regime
have been performed with the signals from the BBH
mergers detected by the LIGO interferometers [2–5,10].
In GR, GWs are characterized by two tensor (spin-2)
polarizations only, whereas generic metric theories may
allow up to six polarizations [11,12]. As the two LIGO
instruments have similar orientations, little information
about polarizations can be obtained using the LIGO
detectors alone. With the addition of Advanced Virgo
we can probe, for the first time, gravitational-wave polarizations geometrically by projecting the wave’s amplitude

The imminent detection of gravitational waves will trigger precision tests of gravity through
observations of quasinormal ringing of black holes. While General Relativity predicts just two polarizations of gravitational waves, the so-called plus and cross polarizations, numerous alternative
theories of gravity predict up to six different polarizations which will potentially be observed in
current and future generations of gravitational wave detectors. Bekenstein’s Tensor-Vector-Scalar
(TeVeS) theory and its generalization fall into one such class of theory that predict the full gamut
of six polarizations of gravitational waves. In this paper we begin the study of quasinormal modes
(QNMs) in TeVeS by studying perturbations of the scalar field in a spherically symmetric background. We show that, at least in the case where superluminal propagation of perturbations is
not present, black holes are generically stable to this kind of perturbation. We also make a unique
prediction that, as the
√ limit of the various coupling parameters of the theory tend to zero, the QNM
spectrum tends to 1/ 2 times the QNM spectrum induced by scalar perturbations of a Schwarzschild
black hole in General Relativity due to the intrinsic presence of the background vector field. We
further show that the QNM spectrum does not vary significantly from this value for small values of
the theory’s coupling parameters, however can vary by as much as a few percent for larger, but still
physically relevant parameters.

INTRODUCTION

Perturbations of black holes have been intensely studied during the past decades with relation to black hole
stability, astrophysical implications of gravitational wave
detection and, more recently, gauge/gravity dualities (see
the reviews [1–4]). From an astrophysical perspective,
the impending observation of gravitational waves from
black holes will herald new and unprecedented tests of
gravity through two main avenues. The first is through
the possible detection of gravitational wave polarizations
that are not predicted by General Relativity (GR) such
as scalar “breathing modes” and extra tensor and vector
degrees of freedom1 . The second method is a direct probe
of the no-hair theorem of GR through observations of the
quasinormal ringing of black holes known as quasinormal
modes (QNMs). General Relativity predicts that the simultaneous measurement of the frequency and damping
time of a single QNM is sufficient to determine both the
mass and angular momentum of a black hole [12–16],
implying the detection of more than one QNM from a

single black hole can give rigorous constraints on the nohair theorem – one of the major science goals for ground
based and space based gravitational wave detectors [e.g.
16–19]. An alternative approach to the measurement of
the frequencies of black hole QNMs based on a connection
between the emission of gravitational waves and strong
gravitational lensing has recently been elucidated in Stefanov et al. [20].
A recently popular alternative theory of gravity that
predicts both extra polarizations of gravitational wave
propagation as well as a violation of the no-hair theorem
is Bekenstein’s Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) theory [21]
and its generalization [22–24]. In this paper we take a
first step towards exploring the perturbations of black
holes within TeVeS and its generalization by studying
perturbations of the background scalar field. This enables us to look at both the stability of black holes in the
theories, as well as looking at how the QNM frequencies
and damping times are affected by the various parameters of the theories.
TeVeS is a covariant generalization of the Modified
Newtonian Dynamics (MoND) paradigm [25], which attempts to explain the discrepancy between observed and
predicted mass distributions on galactic scales. As a tool
for interpreting galactic scale observations, MoND has
proven extremely successful (see [26] for a review). However, as a non-covariant theory it is ill-equipped to explain the full gamut of astrophysical and cosmological
observations. To this end, TeVeS has recently been employed in an attempt to explain, amongst other things,

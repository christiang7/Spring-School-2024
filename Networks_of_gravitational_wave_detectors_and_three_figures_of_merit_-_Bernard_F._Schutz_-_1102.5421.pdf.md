Abstract. This paper develops a general framework for studying the effectiveness of
networks of interferometric gravitational wave detectors and then uses it to show that
enlarging the existing LIGO-VIRGO network with one or more planned or proposed
detectors in Japan (LCGT), Australia, and India brings major benefits, including
much larger detection rate increases than previously thought. I focus on detecting
bursts, i.e. short-duration signals, with optimal coherent data-analysis methods. I
show that the polarization-averaged sensitivity of any network of identical detectors to
any class of sources can be characterized by two numbers – the visibility distance of the
expected source from a single detector and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
a confident detection – and one angular function, the antenna pattern of the network.
I show that there is a universal probability distribution function (pdf) for detected
SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first detected event
will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I also derive the universal
pdf for detected values of the orbital inclination, taking into account the Malmquist
bias; this implies that the number of gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary
coalescences should be 3.4 times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction
of the gamma burst. Using network antenna patterns, I propose three figures of merit
that characterize the relative performance of different networks. These measure (a)
the expected rate of detection by the network and any sub-networks of three or more
separated detectors, taking into account the duty cycle of the interferometers, (b)
the isotropy of the network antenna pattern, and (c) the accuracy of the network at
localizing the positions of events on the sky. I compare various likely and possible
networks, based on these figures of merit. Adding any new site to the planned LIGOVIRGO network can dramatically increase, by factors of 2 to 4, the detected event
rate by allowing coherent data analysis to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident
background. Moving one of the LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves
direction-finding by a factor of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO-VIRGO
network not only improves direction-finding but will further increase the detection rate
over the extra-site gain by factors of almost 2, partly by improving the network duty
cycle. Including LCGT, LIGO-Australia, and a detector in India gives a network with
position error ellipses a factor of 7 smaller in area and boosts the detected event rate
a further 2.4 times above the extra-site gain over the original LIGO-VIRGO network.
Enlarged advanced networks could look forward to detecting three to four hundred
neutron star binary coalescences per year.

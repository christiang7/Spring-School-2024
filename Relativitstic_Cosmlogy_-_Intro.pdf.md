RELATIVISTIC COSMOLOGY

3.1

The Robertson-Walker Metric

The appearance of objects at cosmological distances is affected by the
curvature of spacetime through which light travels on its way to Earth. The
most complete description of the geometrical properties of the Universe is
provided by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In GR, the fundamental
quantity is the metric which describes the geometry of spacetime.
Let’s look at the definition of a metric: in 3-D space we measure the
distance along a curved path P between two points using the differential
distance formula, or metric:
(d`)2 = (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2

(3.1)

and integrating along the path P (a line integral) to calculate the total
distance:

Similarly, to measure the interval along a curved wordline, W, connecting
two events in spacetime with no mass present, we use the metric for flat
spacetime:
(ds)2 = (cdt)2 − (dx)2 − (dy)2 − (dz)2
(3.3)
Integrating ds gives the total interval along the worldline W:
∆s =

(ds)2 =

(cdt)2 − (dx)2 − (dy)2 − (dz)2

By definition, the distance measured between two events, A and B, in a
reference frame for which they occur simultaneously (tA = tB ) is the proper
distance:

∆L = −(∆s)2

Our search for a metric that describes the spacetime of a matter-filled
universe, is made easier by the cosmological principle. In a homogeneous
and isotropic universe, although the curvature of space may change with
